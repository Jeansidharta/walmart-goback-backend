# Walmart Goback

The project is explained in the
[front-end repository](https://github.com/Jeansidharta/walmart-goback-frontend)

## The Back-End

A rust project built using [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum),
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) and
[openapi](https://www.openapis.org/). This will mainly just save and retrieve
carts that were scanned. This is not vital for the whole project to work

## The Router

The code that actually finds the best route can be found
[here](https://github.com/Jeansidharta/walmart-goback-route). It's a rust
project compiled to WASM.

## The Map

The map is an SVG image edited with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). The repo
can be found [here](https://github.com/Jeansidharta/walmart-goback-map)
